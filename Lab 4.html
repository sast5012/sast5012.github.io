<!-- I suggest using the html5 doctype. We could also get away with xhtml 1.0 Strict or or html 4.1 Strict for the “Doctype”; but because of the increasing support for html 5 in browsers and its additional semantic elements, we’re going to use it in the projects for this class -->
<!-- See http://www.w3.org/QA/2002/04/valid-dtd-list.html for list of valid doctypes -->

<!--Before html5 we would have divided the sections of the page up using "divs" -->
<!--However we’ll use the new semantic elements provided with HTML 5 such as -->
<!--“header”, “footer”, "nav”, etc., instead -->
<!-- We will also be using WAI-ARIA roles to add more semantic meaning to our code. Example WAI-ARIA roles are “banner”, “main”, “search” and “form”. WAI-ARIA is the acronym for Web Access Initiative – Accessible Rich Internet Applications. We will talk more about WAI-ARIA and the new HTML 5 semantic elements in more detail later in the course, particularly in Module 13. For now note that WAI-ARIA and the new HTML 5 semantic element assist both Assistive Technologies (such as screenreaders), search engines and other code-reading technologies to navigate and understand the identify the meaning of a page. -->
